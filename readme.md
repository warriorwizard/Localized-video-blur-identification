Video Blur Detection
This Python script uses OpenCV to analyze a video and detect blurry regions within specified divisions of the video frame. It can be useful for tasks like identifying areas of low image quality in surveillance footage or other video sources.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
You can install OpenCV and NumPy using pip:

Video blur detection along with segmentation and processing the image by dividing it into mutiple partition and then processing each frame"# image-multisegmentation-blur-detection"
